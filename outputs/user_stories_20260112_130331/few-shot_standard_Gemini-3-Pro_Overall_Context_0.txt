> **Examining Project Goals**
> 
> I'm currently focused on the project summary for PROTECT-CHILD. My primary task involves breaking down the project into manageable user stories. Analyzing the goals will help me define the users and their needs within the data integration context. I'll need to identify the core functionalities required for pediatric transplant data.

> **Mapping User Roles and Needs**
> 
> The focus has shifted towards identifying key stakeholders. I'm actively defining roles like clinicians, researchers, and data managers. I'm also now linking each role to specific needs, such as access to harmonized data, support for advanced analytics, and data security. The goal is to clearly map roles to functional areas to shape the user stories.

> **Refining User Story Drafts**
> 
> I'm now deep in the user story drafting phase. Refining the initial drafts involves defining actors and benefits and specifying acceptance criteria. I'm focusing on "Data Harmonization" and "Federated Querying" stories. The goal is to move from general descriptions to precise, testable statements. I'm also ensuring the stories align with the PROTECT-CHILD project's core objectives and stakeholder needs.

> **Developing Story Structures**
> 
> I'm now iterating on user story templates. I'm focusing on "Data Harmonization," "Federated Querying," "Clinical Decision Support," and "Genomic Data Integration." I'm also now adding specific actors and benefits to the stories to improve clarity, with criteria to ensure testability. I'm paying close attention to the project summary and stakeholder needs.

> **Developing Story Structures Again**
> 
> I'm now revisiting the user stories and templates with a heightened focus on the "Federated" aspects, which are key. I'm ensuring that the stories reflect the decentralized nature of data analysis within the PROTECT-CHILD project. The acceptance criteria must also ensure that the data remains secure and private. I'm also ensuring the inclusion of "Genomic" data integration.

Based on the PROTECT-CHILD project summary and the definitions provided, here is a set of user stories designed to address the functional and non-functional requirements of the platform.

### 1. US #1.1 – Federated Data Analysis
**As a** Researcher
**I want to** execute analytical models and queries across distributed datasets located at various hospitals and registries
**So that** I can identify predictors of transplant success on a large scale without accessing or moving the raw, sensitive patient data.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- The platform allows the user to select specific variables (clinical and genomic) for analysis.
- The system distributes the computation (algorithm) to the local nodes (hospitals) rather than centralizing the data.
- Only aggregated, anonymized statistical results are returned to the Researcher.
- The system prevents the reconstruction of individual patient records from the returned results (differential privacy).

**Additional notes:**
- This functionality must adhere to the "Privacy-Preserving Infrastructure" requirement.
- Algorithms must be validated for security before execution.

### 2. US #1.2 – Data Harmonization and Standardization
**As a** Data Manager at a Clinical Center
**I want to** map my local heterogeneous clinical and genomic data to a common PROTECT-CHILD standard (e.g., HL7 FHIR, OMOP)
**So that** my institution's data is interoperable and can be included in pan-European federated studies.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- The platform provides tools or scripts to assist in the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process from local formats to the common data model.
- A validation engine checks the data against the defined metadata standards and flags inconsistencies.
- Both clinical history (phenotype) and genomic data (genotype) are supported in the harmonization process.

**Additional notes:**
- This addresses the "Data Harmonization and Interoperability" requirement.
- Local implementation support is required to ensure data stays within the hospital firewall.

### 3. US #1.3 – Clinical Decision Support (CDS) Interface
**As a** Paediatric Transplant Clinician
**I want to** access a decision support dashboard that uses machine-learning models trained on the federated network
**So that** I can receive risk stratification and personalized treatment recommendations for my specific patient.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- The interface allows the clinician to input specific patient parameters (or pull them from the Electronic Health Record).
- The system returns a risk score or prediction (e.g., probability of rejection) based on the aggregated European knowledge base.
- The prediction includes confidence intervals or "explainability" metrics to support clinical judgment.

**Additional notes:**
- This fulfills the "Advanced Analytics for Clinical Decision Support" requirement.
- The system must ensure high availability as it is used in a clinical setting.

### 4. US #1.4 – Genomic Data Integration
**As a** Bioinformatician
**I want to** integrate high-volume genomic sequencing data into the local PROTECT-CHILD node
**So that** genomic markers can be correlated with clinical outcomes in the federated analysis.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- The system supports standard genomic file formats (e.g., VCF, BAM) or structured genomic databases.
- Genomic data is securely linked to the corresponding clinical data via a pseudonymized identifier.
- The infrastructure handles the storage and processing requirements specific to large genomic datasets.

**Additional notes:**
- This is crucial for the "genomic data integration" aspect of the project scope.

### 5. US #1.5 – Compliance and Consent Management
**As a** Data Protection Officer (DPO)
**I want to** audit the usage of data and manage patient consent settings within the platform
**So that** the institution remains compliant with GDPR, EHDS, and ethical requirements regarding paediatric data.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- The system maintains an immutable log of who executed which analysis and when.
- The system checks for valid patient consent flags before including a specific record in any federated calculation.
- A dashboard is provided to revoke data availability if a patient/guardian withdraws consent.

**Additional notes:**
- This addresses "Strong Governance and Compliance."
- Special attention must be paid to the rights of minors and the transition of consent as they age.

### 6. US #1.6 – Cross-Border Registry Connection
**As a** Registry Curator
**I want to** connect my existing rare disease registry to the PROTECT-CHILD infrastructure
**So that** the historical data contained in my registry can be reused to increase the statistical power of transplant research.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- The platform provides APIs or connectors specifically designed for established registry software.
- Data ingestion handles the specific fragmentation issues typical of rare disease datasets.
- Duplicate detection mechanisms are in place to prevent counting the same patient twice if they exist in both a hospital database and a registry.

**Additional notes:**
- Addresses the requirement to solve "fragmentation... across countries and institutions."
