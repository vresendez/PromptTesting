Based on the project summary provided for PROTECT-CHILD, and adopting the persona of an experienced Biostatistician and Clinical Trials Coordinator based in Madrid, I have analyzed the requirements and developed the following user stories.

### 1. Requirements Analysis

Before generating the user stories, I have categorized the project needs into Functional and Non-Functional Requirements based on the provided definitions and project goals.

#### Functional Requirements (What the system must do)
*   **Distributed Analysis Execution:** The system must allow the execution of statistical models and machine-learning algorithms across distributed datasets (federated learning) without moving the raw data to a central repository.
*   **Data Integration:** The platform must be able to integrate heterogeneous data types, specifically combining clinical health records with genomic data.
*   **Data Harmonization:** The system must provide mechanisms to align diverse data formats from different institutions with international standards (e.g., HL7).
*   **Predictive Modeling:** The system must support the creation and validation of risk stratification models and predictors for transplant success or complications.
*   **Clinical Decision Support:** The platform must output analysis results in a format that supports evidence-based, personalized clinical decision-making.

#### Non-Functional Requirements (Qualities and Constraints)
*   **Privacy Preservation:** The architecture must ensure that sensitive patient information is never exposed or centralized, adhering to a "privacy-by-design" approach.
*   **Regulatory Compliance:** The system must operate in full alignment with GDPR, the European Health Data Space (EHDS), and ethical requirements for pediatric data.
*   **Interoperability:** The infrastructure must be interoperable across different European hospitals, registries, and research centers.
*   **Trust and Security:** The environment must be verifiable as "trusted" by all participating legal entities to allow for cross-border collaboration.

### 2. User Stories

As a Biostatistician and Clinical Trials Coordinator, my focus is on statistical power, data validity, and the translation of complex data into clinical evidence, all while navigating the strict regulatory landscape of European clinical trials.

**1. The "Statistical Power" Story**
"As a **Biostatistician**, I want to **query and analyze distributed datasets across multiple European institutions without centralizing the raw data**, so that I can **achieve the necessary sample size and statistical power to identify predictors of transplant success in rare pediatric cases that are statistically impossible to find in single-center studies.**"

**2. The "Data Harmonization" Story**
"As a **Clinical Trials Coordinator**, I want the platform to **automatically harmonize heterogeneous clinical and registry data using international standards (like HL7)**, so that I can **ensure the variables used in my statistical models are consistent across different countries, reducing the risk of invalid conclusions due to data formatting errors.**"

**3. The "Genomic Integration" Story**
"As a **Biostatistician specializing in modeling**, I want to **integrate genomic data with clinical health outcomes within the federated analysis environment**, so that I can **develop advanced risk stratification models that account for genetic factors in transplant complications.**"

**4. The "GDPR Compliance" Story**
"As a **Clinical Trials Coordinator**, I need the system to **guarantee that my analysis requests never expose sensitive patient identifiers to me or the central server**, so that I can **conduct cross-border research that is fully compliant with GDPR and ethical constraints, avoiding legal barriers that usually halt these studies.**"

**5. The "Personalized Medicine" Story**
"As a **Biostatistician**, I want to **apply machine-learning methods to the federated network to generate predictive scores**, so that I can **provide clinicians with evidence-based support tools for personalized treatment strategies, moving beyond generic protocols.**"

**6. The "Scalability" Story**
"As a **Researcher**, I want to **reuse existing rare-disease data residing in unconnected registries**, so that I can **validate my hypotheses on historical data without needing to recruit new patients for a lengthy prospective study.**"
