Based on the analysis of the **PROTECT-CHILD** project summary, here are the Functional and Non-Functional Requirements, followed by a set of User Stories written from the perspective of an expert Pediatric Gastroenterologist and Hepatologist.

### 1. Requirements Analysis

#### Functional Requirements (What the system must do)
Based on the text, the system must:
*   **FR1 - Federated Analysis:** Allow joint analysis of distributed data (clinical and genomic) without centralizing raw patient information.
*   **FR2 - Data Integration:** Integrate heterogeneous data from hospitals, registries, and research centers.
*   **FR3 - Predictive Modeling:** Support the development and application of machine-learning models to identify predictors of transplant success or complications.
*   **FR4 - Risk Stratification:** Provide tools for developing reliable risk stratification strategies based on the aggregated data.
*   **FR5 - Clinical Decision Support:** Enable evidence-based and personalized clinical decision-making using advanced analytics.
*   **FR6 - Data Standardization:** Align disparate data formats with international standards (e.g., HL7, metadata standards).

#### Non-Functional Requirements (System qualities and constraints)
Based on the text, the system must adhere to:
*   **NFR1 - Privacy & Security:** Ensure a "privacy-preserving environment" that avoids raw data centralization to reduce security risks.
*   **NFR2 - Compliance:** Maintain full alignment with GDPR, European Health Data Space (EHDS), and ethical requirements.
*   **NFR3 - Interoperability:** Ensure the infrastructure is interoperable across different European countries and institutions.
*   **NFR4 - Scalability:** Enable the scalable reuse of rare-disease data across Europe.
*   **NFR5 - Trustworthiness:** Operate as a "trusted" infrastructure involving legal experts, clinicians, and patients in the governance.

### 2. User Stories

**Persona:** Dr. Elena M., Pediatric Gastroenterologist and Hepatologist (10+ years experience in liver transplantation).

**Context:** I treat children with rare liver diseases who require transplants. My biggest challenge is that my local dataset is too small to make statistically significant predictions about complications or long-term outcomes. I need access to European-wide data to improve my patients' survival and quality of life.

#### Theme: Clinical Decision Support & Personalized Medicine
1.  **As a** Pediatric Hepatologist,
    **I want** to access a clinical decision support system derived from European-wide datasets,
    **So that** I can make personalized treatment decisions for my rare liver transplant patients based on evidence larger than my local hospital's cohort.

2.  **As a** Pediatric Hepatologist,
    **I want** to use risk stratification tools built on diverse, cross-border data,
    **So that** I can better identify which of my patients are at high risk for transplant complications or rejection.

3.  **As a** Pediatric Hepatologist,
    **I want** the system to analyze genomic data alongside clinical history,
    **So that** I can identify specific genetic predictors of transplant success for children with autoimmune liver disorders.

#### Theme: Data Access & Analysis (Federated Learning)
4.  **As a** researcher in pediatric transplantation,
    **I want** to run analytical queries across distributed datasets from multiple European hospitals without moving the patient data,
    **So that** I can perform statistical analysis on a large sample size while respecting the privacy of the children involved.

5.  **As a** clinician-researcher,
    **I want** to utilize machine-learning models trained on fragmented datasets,
    **So that** I can discover new patterns or predictors of long-term outcomes that are impossible to see in small, isolated datasets.

#### Theme: Interoperability & Standardization
6.  **As a** Pediatric Hepatologist contributing data,
    **I want** the system to automatically align my hospital's heterogeneous data formats with international standards (like HL7),
    **So that** my patient data can be effectively integrated with data from other European registries for joint analysis.

#### Theme: Privacy, Trust & Compliance
7.  **As a** clinician responsible for sensitive patient data,
    **I want** assurance that the analysis infrastructure is fully GDPR and EHDS compliant,
    **So that** I can participate in this European network without fear of violating legal or ethical barriers regarding my patients' privacy.

8.  **As a** Pediatric Hepatologist,
    **I want** to use a system that avoids centralizing raw patient files,
    **So that** the security risks associated with mass data exposure are minimized while still allowing me to benefit from the collective intelligence of the network.
