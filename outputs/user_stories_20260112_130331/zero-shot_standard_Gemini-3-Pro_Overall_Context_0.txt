> **Identifying Key Themes**

> I've moved from the initial analysis of the project to pinpointing key themes. The PROTECT-CHILD project summary reveals a strong emphasis on federated learning for privacy. Data harmonization, advanced analytics, and regulatory compliance are other critical aspects. I'm now sorting requirements into functional and non-functional categories, readying them for user story creation.

Based on the project summary and the definitions provided, here is a comprehensive set of user stories for the PROTECT-CHILD project.

These stories are categorized by the type of user (persona) to ensure all stakeholders' needs are addressed.

### I. Clinical & Medical Professionals
*These users need actionable insights to improve patient care.*

1.  **As a Paediatric Transplant Clinician**, I want to access a dashboard that aggregates analysis results from multiple European hospitals, so that I can compare my patient's risk factors against a larger, statistically significant cohort.
2.  **As a Clinician**, I want to receive personalized risk stratification scores for my transplant patients based on integrated genomic and clinical data, so that I can tailor immunosuppression therapies more effectively.
3.  **As a Medical Researcher**, I want to query distributed datasets for specific rare transplant complications without seeing the raw patient data, so that I can identify predictors of success while respecting patient privacy.
4.  **As a Surgeon**, I want to input my patient's pre-operative data into a predictive model, so that I can receive evidence-based probabilities regarding long-term transplant survival.
5.  **As a Hospital Data Manager**, I want to easily map my local hospital's data format to the PROTECT-CHILD standard (e.g., HL7), so that our data can be included in the federated network without manual re-entry.

### II. Data Scientists & Researchers
*These users need to build models and analyze data without breaching privacy.*

6.  **As a Data Scientist**, I want to train machine learning models on federated data across different institutions, so that I can build robust algorithms without ever moving or viewing the raw sensitive data.
7.  **As a Bioinformatician**, I want to integrate genomic sequencing data with clinical registry data within the platform, so that I can discover genetic markers associated with transplant rejection.
8.  **As a Researcher**, I want to view metadata and data quality reports for the available datasets, so that I can assess if the data is suitable for my specific research question before initiating a study.
9.  **As an Algorithm Developer**, I want to deploy my analysis code to the local nodes (hospitals) via a secure containerized system, so that the computation happens locally ("bringing analysis to the data").

### III. Legal, Ethics & Governance Officers
*These users ensure the system remains compliant and trustworthy.*

10. **As a Data Protection Officer (DPO)**, I want to audit a log of all queries and analysis requests sent to my institution's data node, so that I can verify compliance with GDPR and local regulations.
11. **As an Ethics Committee Member**, I want to review and approve research protocols within the platform before any data access is granted, so that I can ensure the study aligns with ethical standards for paediatric patients.
12. **As a Compliance Officer**, I want the system to automatically enforce "privacy budgets" or differential privacy techniques, so that no specific patient can be re-identified through repeated queries.
13. **As a Legal Advisor**, I want to manage digital contracts and data usage agreements directly within the platform, so that cross-border data collaboration is legally binding and transparent.

### IV. Patients & Families
*These users are the ultimate beneficiaries and data subjects.*

14. **As a Patient/Guardian**, I want to be informed about how my (or my child's) data is being used for research, so that I can maintain trust in the medical system.
15. **As a Patient Representative**, I want to see high-level summaries of research outcomes facilitated by the platform, so that I can advocate for the benefits of data sharing within the patient community.
16. **As a Patient**, I want to have the "right to be forgotten" respected, meaning if I withdraw consent, my data is automatically excluded from future federated learning rounds.

### V. System Administrators & IT Security
*These users manage the non-functional requirements and infrastructure.*

17. **As a System Administrator**, I want to monitor the uptime and connectivity of all federated nodes, so that I can ensure the infrastructure is available for critical clinical decision support.
18. **As a Security Architect**, I want to implement multi-factor authentication and strict role-based access control (RBAC), so that only authorized personnel can initiate analysis tasks.
19. **As an IT Manager**, I want the platform to be interoperable with existing Electronic Health Records (EHR) systems, so that we do not have to purchase or install proprietary hardware.
20. **As a Network Engineer**, I want all data transmission between nodes to be encrypted end-to-end, so that sensitive health information is never exposed during the aggregation of results.
