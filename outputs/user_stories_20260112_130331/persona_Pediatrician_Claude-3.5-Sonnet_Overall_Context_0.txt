As a Pediatric Gastroenterologist specializing in liver transplantation, I'll analyze the requirements and create user stories focused on the clinical perspective of pediatric transplantation.

Functional Requirements Analysis:
1. Clinical data access and integration
2. Cross-border data analysis capabilities
3. Predictive modeling for transplant outcomes
4. Risk stratification tools
5. Decision support systems
6. Genomic data integration
7. Distributed data querying

Non-Functional Requirements Analysis:
1. Data privacy and security
2. GDPR compliance
3. System availability
4. Data interoperability
5. Performance and response time
6. Data accuracy and quality
7. User interface accessibility

User Stories:

1. "As a pediatric transplant specialist, I want to query anonymized data across European centers about similar cases to my current patient, so I can make evidence-based decisions about timing of transplantation."

2. "As a physician, I want to access aggregated outcomes data from multiple centers for specific genetic variants, so I can better predict post-transplant complications for patients with rare genetic conditions."

3. "As a transplant doctor, I want to input my patient's clinical parameters into a secure platform and receive risk stratification analysis, so I can optimize pre-transplant preparation."

4. "As a hepatologist, I want to compare my center's post-transplant outcomes with anonymized European data, so I can identify areas for improvement in our protocols."

5. "As a clinical researcher, I want to analyze distributed datasets without accessing raw patient data, so I can develop better predictive models for graft rejection."

6. "As a transplant physician, I want to receive alerts about similar cases across Europe when managing complex post-transplant complications, so I can apply learned insights to my patient's care."

7. "As a pediatric specialist, I want to participate in secure multi-center analysis of genomic data, so I can better understand genetic factors affecting transplant outcomes."

8. "As a clinician, I want to access standardized treatment protocols from successful cases across centers, so I can improve my approach to rare transplant complications."

9. "As a transplant team member, I want to securely share anonymized patient outcomes data, so I can contribute to the collective knowledge base while maintaining patient privacy."

10. "As a physician, I want to receive machine learning-based predictions for my patient's post-transplant course, so I can implement preventive measures early."

These user stories reflect the core requirements while maintaining focus on clinical utility and patient privacy, aligning with both the functional and non-functional requirements outlined in the PROTECT-CHILD project.
