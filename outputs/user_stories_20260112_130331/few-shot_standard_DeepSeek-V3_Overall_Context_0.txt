### **User Stories for PROTECT-CHILD**  

#### **1. US #1.1 (PROTECT-CHILD, ENG) – Federated Data Integration**  
**As a** Clinician or Researcher  
**I want to** securely access and analyze distributed paediatric transplant data from multiple European institutions  
**So that** I can derive insights without compromising patient privacy  

**Acceptance criteria:**  
- Data remains decentralized and is never fully centralized  
- Access is granted only to authorized users with proper authentication  
- Data is harmonized according to HL7/FHIR or other relevant standards  
- Privacy-preserving techniques (e.g., federated learning, differential privacy) are applied  

**Additional notes:**  
- Compliance with GDPR and EHDS is mandatory  
- Data access logs must be maintained for audit purposes

#### **2. US #1.2 (PROTECT-CHILD, ENG) – Data Harmonization & Standardization**  
**As a** Data Manager  
**I want to** convert heterogeneous clinical and genomic data into a standardized format  
**So that** it can be interoperable across different institutions  

**Acceptance criteria:**  
- Supports multiple input formats (e.g., OMOP, HL7, FHIR, genomic data formats)  
- Metadata is aligned with international standards  
- A validation tool ensures compliance with PROTECT-CHILD’s data model  

**Additional notes:**  
- Transformation rules must be documented and version-controlled

#### **3. US #1.3 (PROTECT-CHILD, ENG) – Privacy-Preserving Analytics**  
**As a** Researcher  
**I want to** run machine learning models on distributed datasets without direct access to raw data  
**So that** I can identify predictors of transplant success while preserving privacy  

**Acceptance criteria:**  
- Federated learning or secure multi-party computation (SMPC) is supported  
- Models can be trained across multiple institutions without data leaving its source  
- Results are aggregated and anonymized before sharing  

**Additional notes:**  
- Ethical approval must be obtained before running analyses

#### **4. US #1.4 (PROTECT-CHILD, ENG) – Role-Based Access Control**  
**As a** System Administrator  
**I want to** define and enforce access permissions based on user roles  
**So that** only authorized personnel can view or analyze sensitive data  

**Acceptance criteria:**  
- Roles (e.g., clinician, researcher, data steward) are clearly defined  
- Access levels are configurable per dataset  
- Audit logs track all data access attempts  

**Additional notes:**  
- Must comply with GDPR’s principle of least privilege  

---  

#### **5. US #1.5 (PROTECT-CHILD, ENG) – Patient Consent Management**  
**As a** Legal/Compliance Officer  
**I want to** manage and track patient consent for data usage  
**So that** data sharing adheres to ethical and legal requirements  

**Acceptance criteria:**  
- Consent forms are stored and retrievable  
- Consent status is checked before data access  
- Patients (or guardians) can revoke consent at any time  

**Additional notes:**  
- Must support GDPR’s right to erasure and withdrawal of consent  

---  

#### **6. US #1.6 (PROTECT-CHILD, ENG) – Clinical Decision Support**  
**As a** Paediatric Transplant Specialist  
**I want to** receive AI-driven risk predictions and treatment recommendations  
**So that** I can make evidence-based decisions for my patients  

**Acceptance criteria:**  
- Models are trained on federated datasets  
- Explanations for predictions are provided (interpretability)  
- Recommendations align with clinical guidelines  

**Additional notes:**  
- Must be validated by medical experts before deployment  

---  

#### **7. US #1.7 (PROTECT-CHILD, ENG) – Audit & Compliance Reporting**  
**As a** Data Protection Officer  
**I want to** generate reports on data access and usage  
**So that** I can ensure compliance with GDPR and EHDS  

**Acceptance criteria:**  
- Logs include user actions, accessed datasets, and timestamps  
- Reports can be exported for regulatory audits  
- Anomalies (e.g., unauthorized access attempts) trigger alerts  

**Additional notes:**  
- Reports must be tamper-proof
