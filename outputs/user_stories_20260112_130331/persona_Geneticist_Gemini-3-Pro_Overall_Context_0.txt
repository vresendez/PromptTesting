Based on the **PROTECT-CHILD Project Summary** and my expertise as a **Pediatric Geneticist specializing in rare disorders and clinical genomics**, I have analyzed the project requirements.

Below is the breakdown of the Functional and Non-Functional Requirements derived strictly from the text, followed by User Stories tailored to my role in supporting pediatric transplantation.

### 1. Requirements Analysis

#### Functional Requirements
*   **Federated Data Querying:** The system must allow the execution of analytical queries across distributed datasets (hospitals, registries, research centers) without centralizing the raw data.
*   **Data Integration:** The system must integrate heterogeneous health data types, specifically combining clinical data with genomic data.
*   **Harmonization:** The system must map incoming data to international standards (e.g., HL7, metadata standards) to resolve differences in formats across institutions.
*   **Predictive Modeling:** The system must provide tools for advanced analytics and machine learning to identify predictors of transplant success or complications.
*   **Decision Support:** The system must generate outputs that support evidence-based, personalized clinical decision-making and risk stratification.

#### Non-Functional Requirements
*   **Privacy & Compliance:** The infrastructure must be fully aligned with GDPR, EHDS (European Health Data Space), and ethical requirements, ensuring no exposure of sensitive patient information.
*   **Interoperability:** The architecture must be interoperable, adhering to agreed-upon international standards to handle diverse data sources.
*   **Security:** The environment must be "trusted" and secure, utilizing privacy-preserving technologies to mitigate risks associated with data sharing.
*   **Scalability:** The system must be capable of handling and analyzing datasets scattered across multiple countries and institutions in Europe.
*   **Accessibility:** The system must make data accessible for analysis to authorized clinicians and researchers despite the geographical fragmentation.

### 2. User Stories (Pediatric Geneticist Persona)

As a Geneticist supporting pediatric transplantation, my focus is on overcoming the statistical limitations of rare disease cohorts to find genomic markers that influence transplant outcomes.

1.  **As a Pediatric Geneticist,** I want to query distributed genomic and clinical datasets across multiple European institutions without moving the raw data, **so that** I can access a sufficiently large and diverse cohort to statistically validate rare genetic markers associated with transplant outcomes.
2.  **As a Clinical Genomicist,** I want the platform to automatically harmonize heterogeneous genomic data formats into international standards (e.g., HL7), **so that** I can integrate registry data with genomic sequencing results without spending excessive time on manual data cleaning or reformatting.
3.  **As a Pediatric Geneticist,** I want to apply advanced machine-learning models to the federated network, **so that** I can identify complex genomic predictors of transplant complications (such as rejection or drug toxicity) that are invisible in small, local datasets.
4.  **As a Geneticist,** I want to conduct my research within a privacy-preserving infrastructure that guarantees raw patient data is never centralized, **so that** I can collaborate with international colleagues while remaining fully compliant with GDPR and ethical constraints regarding sensitive genetic information.
5.  **As a Pediatric Geneticist,** I want to use the system's risk stratification insights to develop personalized treatment strategies, **so that** I can provide evidence-based recommendations to the transplant team that improve the long-term survival and quality of life for the child.
6.  **As a Clinical Genomicist,** I want to access a trusted environment that links health-related data with genomic data, **so that** I can move from general clinical observations to data-driven, precision medicine approaches for rare transplant cases.
